# 👋 Hey, I'm 15 aka Ustteki

I'm a Python & Lua developer with a focus on Discord bots, automation tools, and Roblox script development. I've been deep in the scripting scene for a while — including contributions to multiple major scripthubs with over 40k+ users. 

This is my new GitHub — my last one got taken down, but we keep building. Always.
